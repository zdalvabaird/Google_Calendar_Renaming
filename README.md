# Google_Calendar_Renaming
 
This Python script helps you copy and rename events from one Google Calendar to another. It's handy for renaming calendar events, especially for schedules or class blocks.

## Usage

1. Set up Google Calendar API credentials:
   - Create a Google Developer Console project.
   - Save OAuth credentials in `credentials.json` (place it in the script's directory).

2. Edit the `schedule` dictionary in the `main` function with your event name changes.

3. Run the script:

   ```bash
   python calendar_pull_push.py
